    	<h2>My History</h2>        
        <p>
        I always knew I wanted to work with computers, along with design.
        Talk to my father, and he'll tell you the same story when I was in grade school. I was in First Grade, and our school just got computers for each class.
        Since it was a time where computers were fairly rare, some of the teachers had no idea how to turn on a computer, much less work on one.
        My teacher was having a hard time turning hers on, so I decided to help her by turning it on. 
        She thought it was amazing that I could do that, especially since our family didn't have a computer of our own. 
        I've always liked computer classes, especially the basic HTML class in grade school. 
        I also liked drawing and creating images, especially logos and designs.
        </p>
        
        <p>After High School, I went to <a href="http://www.kaskaskia.edu" target="_blank">Kaskaskia College</a> 
        and got my certificate in Graphic Design in 2008. I enjoyed the possibility to make logos and other images for a living, 
        but I didn't want to stop there. After a break from school to save money, 
        I decided to go back. I decided to combine my interests by getting an Associate's Degree in Web Design from 
        <a href="http://www.swic.edu" target="_blank">Southwestern Illinois College</a> in 2013, while getting inducted into their honors society, 
        <a href="http://www.ptk.org/" target="_blank">Phi Theta Kappa</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>During my last semester at SWIC, I took an internship at <a href="http://www.techknowsolutions.com" target="_blank">TechKnow Solutions</a> in 
        Breese, Illinois. That was another big stepping stone for me, in my opinion, as it gave me projects that would actually be shown to other clients. 
        I learned even more about design, and was introduced to SharePoint Designer. I've worked on websites through Microsoft's Web Design software ever since!</p>
